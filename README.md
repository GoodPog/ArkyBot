# arkybot
I, dart have leaked this source code for numerous reasons one of them is, i quit gt. and the community
And i also have lost all respect to arky so do whatever you want with the source and also fork it incase it gets termed.

-- code refactored/fixed by slash

## to github
Arky himself, the owner of this source code has said that he doesn't care about the source code being leaked, and now he is supposedly terminating github accounts, we shouldn't be terminated because he himself said he doesn't care.

## Errors and fixes

You might get some vs build tool errors so use VS 2022 (mainly v143 build tools, older have errors)

if theres any errors just open a issue and ill help you i might not check often

dart made this repository, slash handles the repo with issues. because i wont be checking in on it either ways
